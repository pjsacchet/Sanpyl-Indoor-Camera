## Introduction

## Research Goals
In pursuing this IoT device, there were a few questions and goals I had in mind to help guide this work:
- What hardware composed this device?
- Is the firmware easily extractable? 
  - If so, what vulnerabilities exist within the firmware?
- What vulnerabilities existed, if any, in the mobile application?
- What ports/services were open and accessible on the device?
- Is it possible for a malicous actor to intercept video/audio on the device?
- Is it possible for a malicious actor to send commands of their own to move the device?
